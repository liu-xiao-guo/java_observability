This is a demo project for showing how to use Elastic Stack to monitor a Java web service. It includes the following:

- java_monitor: it contains all of the source codes used in the demo
- filebeat: it contains the setup for monitoring logs from the web service
- metricbeat: it contains the setup for monitoring metrics from the service
- heartbeat: it contains the setup for monitoring the uptime of  web services

In addition, APM is also used to monitor the Java web service performance. The artilce can be found at https://elasticstack.blog.csdn.net/article/details/128113010
